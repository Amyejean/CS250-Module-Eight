How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this? 

	* User stories help with creating a baseline of what is needed in the project. But it is the job of the product owner to turn that into something that the team can use to create an outline for the expectations on what is to be delivered at the end of the project. 

How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
	* I use alot of these practices in my day to day job. 


What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

	*Being a good team member is basically knowing everyone has a voice. But also a good solid project is built around communication.
